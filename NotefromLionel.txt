I've never learned Node.Js, React and Next.js before. 
I had to learn everything from scratch and do my own experiments to try to understand how they are different
from the old ways of developing a website using html, css and just javascripts.
The intended functions like pagination, filtering of the data and search bar don't work, can't figure it out. 
Tried alot of tutorials and examples from both youtube and google but to no avail and couldn't find my answers.
Tried using Link href and router to navigate to different pages but for some reason, error 404 always pops up
after I've clicked on the link. It couldn't find the page that I've placed in my folder.

I had to improvise and change my website design to be really simplistic because of these reasons. Wish I could've
done better but no matter what I do, I kept getting errors. Tried React on the first week on the first try.
File wouldn't install properly so I forced installed it, and it corrupted my files. I'm truly sorry that I'm 
not capable of finishing this even tho I was given a second chance by Mr Paul. Thank you & Mr Paul for the 
opportunity and chances that were given to me.
